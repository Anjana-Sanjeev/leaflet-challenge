## Summary
# Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualisation

* Get the dataset from the USGS, which provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. The dataset consists of "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days". The URL of this JSON was used to pull in the data for the visualisation. 

* Import and visualise the data using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Also popup provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked. A legend is also provided that shows the color representation.
